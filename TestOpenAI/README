==================================================
OpenAI's Open Source Mobile Agent System (OSMoSys)
==================================================
This is a simple mobile agent framework in Java.  The agent itself is run as a
thread in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can migrate to other machines.  
For more information, see the JavaDocs in docs/html.  The JavaDocs will have to
be generated (see INSTALL) or can viewed online.


Components
==========

  The Daemon
  ----------
  The Daemon is responsible for managing Agents and providing services to the
  running Agents.  It is also responsible for transporting MobileAgents to
  Daemons running on other hosts.

  The Agent
  ---------
  The heart of an Agent is the "executeAgent()" method.  The Daemon will wrap
  the Agent in a Thread that will run the "executeAgent()" method.

  The MobileAgent
  ---------------
  This is an extension to the Agent class that is transportable to other
  machines The MobileAgent can call "migrateTo()" and specify a host and the
  Daemon will attempt to move the MobileAgent to a Daemon running elsewhere.
  Transmission is done using sockets and utilizes Java's Serialization
  capabilities.  When a MobileAgent migrates to another Daemon, it will in
  essence be restarted.  This means that the MobileAgent itself MUST KEEP
  TRACK OF STATE.  Only MobileAgents will be transported by Daemon.

  DaemonService
  -------------
  This is the base class for any "services" that can be provided to the agent
  system.  This is a special type of non-mobile Agent that (in the future)
  Agents will be able to query the Daemon for and exchange data with.


Installation
============
  Please see the INSTALL file for installation information.


Running the Daemon
==================
  There are several ways to run the Daemon.  The most common would be to
  execute "java net.openai.ai.agent.Daemon <options>".  Execute the command
  without any options for usage information.  The most flexible method for
  running the Daemon is to use the XML config file option and (optionally)
  override the values in the config file on the command line.  For instance:

  $ java net.openai.ai.agent.Daemon -c DaemonConfig.xml -p 4321

  This will execute the Daemon on port 4321 even if the XML file specifies
  otherwise.


Examples
========
  There are several examples included with the package.  They are located
  in the "examples" directory within the top-level java-agents directory.
  After you have compiled OSMoSys itself, you may change over to the each
  of the example directories within the examples directory and execute a
  "javac *.java" to compile each example.
